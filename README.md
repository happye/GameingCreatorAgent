# Gaming Creator Agent

Version repository: [happye/GameingCreatorAgent](https://github.com/happye/GameingCreatorAgent), branch `main`. Keep media, keys, virtual environments, and runtime caches outside tracked files.

This repository is the starting point for a local-first game-content creation tool. The source plan is [`游戏内容创作与商业化产品总方案 V1.0.txt`](./游戏内容创作与商业化产品总方案%20V1.0.txt). The first milestone validates whether a semantic timeline can find useful moments in local game footage before a desktop UI or commercial system is built.

## Current state

The repository contains planning documents, a shared workflow for Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build, and empty source/test directories. There is no application or Python test runner yet. Phase 0 uses Python, SQLite, and FFmpeg; see the [language decision](./docs/design-docs/adr-001-phase-0-language.md). C# is optional and the later desktop UI remains undecided. Model providers must remain replaceable.

## Start here

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md), [`HANDOFF.md`](./HANDOFF.md), and the [shared workflow](./docs/references/agent-workflow.md). Open the same repository or your assigned worktree in whichever tool is available.
2. In PowerShell, run `./scripts/init.ps1 -CheckOnly` to verify scaffold files and `feature_list.json`.
3. Run `./scripts/init.ps1` to check project-local prerequisites. Follow the [isolated environment rules](./docs/references/isolated-environment.md); all tools/packages stay inside `.tools/`, `.venv/`, and `.cache/`.
4. Resume your assigned task; review the [reverse review](./docs/exec-plans/reverse-review-2026-10-03.md), [engineering specification](./docs/design-docs/phase-0-engineering-spec.md), and [task dependencies](./docs/exec-plans/phase-0-plan.md). Record ownership and preserve a concrete handoff.

Build and test commands will be added after the first executable project is created.

## Phase 0 validation utilities

The [2026-10-03 validation report](./docs/exec-plans/phase-0-validation-2026-10-03.md) records real local media/DeepSeek experiments and their limits. Run `./scripts/test-media-spike.ps1 -Synthetic` for the local media smoke and `./scripts/test-retrieval-score.ps1` for fixed-denominator metric regression. `test-deepseek-vision.ps1 -SourcePath <video>` needs process-local `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and makes one paid request of five extracted frames. It is a limited experiment, not the final CLI or a passed retrieval benchmark.

## Tool adapters

| Tool | Repository entry | Loading check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Native `AGENTS.md`; linked supplement `CODEX.md` | Verify active project instructions in a new session |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` | `/memory` in Claude Code |
| Grok Build | `AGENTS.md` and `.grok/rules/project.md` | `grok inspect` from the repository root |

Entry files share rules through `AGENTS.md`; live work state is in `HANDOFF.md`, per-task sprint records, and `feature_list.json`. Follow the shared workflow for separate worktrees and file ownership during parallel development.

Common resumption prompt for any of the three tools:

```text
读取 AGENTS.md、HANDOFF.md 和 feature_list.json，检查当前分支及未提交修改，按共享工作流接续已分配任务；把验证结果和下一步写入仓库交接记录。
```

The local Grok inspection currently reports `projectTrusted: false` and no loaded project instructions. On first use, handle Grok's repository trust prompt, then rerun `grok inspect`. Claude's import is configured, but its live session loading has not been tested here.

Loading behavior was checked against official documentation on 2026-10-03: [Codex project instructions](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md), [Claude Code imports](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#import-additional-files), and [Grok project rules](https://docs.x.ai/build/features/project-rules). Local account permissions and model execution are separate from repository adapter validation.
